# Magician

Library for **easy** image manipulation. Requires ImageMagick.

## Features

1. Conversion from/to different formats
2. Resizing
3. Cropping
4. Defining and executing custom processing on given image (filters, middleware)
5. Ability to set a URL as a source image and it should detect this and automatically download it
6. Defining presets

## Installation

```npm install magician --save```

## Requirements

- node v0.11.x (or newer)
- imagemagick

If you are happy user of Mac, you can install ImageMagick using HomeBrew:

```brew install imagemagick```

or using [ImageMagick Installer](http://cactuslab.com/imagemagick/) by CactusLab.

## Getting Started

Simplest example of using Magician:

```javascript
var Image = require('magician');

var image = new Image('/path/to/image.jpg');
image.format('jpg')
     .width(500)
     .height(300);

var newImage = yield image.save()
// newImage is an Image instance, which points to a newly created image
```

## Guide

Assuming the beginning of all code listings is:

```javascript
var Image = require('magician');
```

#### Conversion from/to different formats

```javascript
var image = new Image('/tmp/image.png');
image.format('jpg');

var convertedImage = yield image.save();
// convertedImage is an Image instance that points to a converted image
// allows further processing without the need to create a new Image
```

Alternative way:

```javascript
var image = new Image('/tmp/image.png');

var convertedImage = yield image.save('/tmp/output.jpg');
// convertedImage is an Image instance that points to a converted image
// allows further processing without the need to create a new Image
```

#### Resizing

```javascript
var image = new Image('/tmp/image.png');
image.width(500)
     .height(300);
     
var resizedImage = yield image.save('/tmp/resized.png');
// resizedImage is an Image instance that points to a resized image
// allows further processing without the need to create a new Image
```

Alternative way:

```javascript
var image = new Image('/tmp/image.png');
image.resize(500, 300);

var resizedImage = yield image.save('/tmp/resized.png');
// resizedImage is an Image instance that points to a resized image
// allows further processing without the need to create a new Image
```

#### Cropping

```javascript
var image = new Image('/tmp/image.png');
image.crop(5, 5, 50, 50); // x, y, width, height

var croppedImage = yield image.save();
// croppedImage is an Image instance that points to a resized image
// allows further processing without the need to create a new Image
```

#### Defining custom processing

```javascript
var image = new Image('/tmp/image.png');
image.use(function *(next) {
   this.set('-trim', '');
   
   yield next;
});

var trimmedImage = yield image.save('/tmp/output.png')
// done
```

#### Ability to set a URL as a source

```javascript
var image = new Image('http://example.com/image.png');
image.format('jpg');

var downloadedImage = yield image.save();
// image downloaded, done
```

#### Defining presets

Presets stop repetition and provide a fast way to use all the needed methods and filters on different Image instances using one line:

```javascript
Image.preset('mobile')
     .width(300)
     .height(240)
     .save();

var image = new Image('/tmp/image.png');
image.use('mobile')

var mobileImage = yield image.save();
// done
```

## Tests

You can run tests by executing:

```npm test```
